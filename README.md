this code was made by me dev6920.

Perks?

2. this can help you if your trying to 'pull' or 'ban' a account.

3. Fully writen in python.

if you get this error ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW("Coded by github.com/dev6920")
AttributeError: module 'ctypes' has no attribute 'windll'

just delete "ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW("Coded by github.com/dev6920")" (line '12')
