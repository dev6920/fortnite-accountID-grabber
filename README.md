this code was made by me dev6920.

Perks?

1. enter any fortnite display name and it sends you the accountID back.
2. this can help you if your trying to 'pull' or 'ban' a account.

3. Fully writen in python.

if you get this error ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW("Coded by github.com/dev6920")
AttributeError: module 'ctypes' has no attribute 'windll'

just delete "ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW("Coded by github.com/dev6920")" (line '12')
